- [Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence: The State of the Art](https://www.iospress.com/catalog/books/neuro-symbolic-artificial-intelligence-the-state-of-the-art) (By Hitzler and Saker): The book is an edited version of review papers from experts in Neurosymbolic AI covering graph neural networks, logics, planning, and natural language processing. 

- [Neural-Symbolic Learning Systems: Foundations and Applications](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-0211-3) By (Garcez, Broda, and Gabbay): The book highlights the inconsistencies in current AI and how neural-symbolic integration is the future. 
  
- [Neuro-Symbolic AI: Design transparent and trustworthy systems that understand the world as you do](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Neuro_Symbolic_AI/d8nAEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Neurosymbolic+AI&printsec=frontcover): (By Dingli and Farrugia) The book covers the history of AI with a focus on the limitations of statistical AI, leading the path to neurosymbolic AI. It covers the opportunities that neurosymbolic AI has, particularly in logic and programming. Further, the notion of explainable AI is also covered. However, the book substantially differs from ours on three fronts: First, the positioning of neurosymbolic AI in our book is more on knowledge created by experts in various forms, such as guidelines, graphs, and others. Second, the notion of explainability and safety in our book focuses on user-level and application-level explainability, which are of significant value to AI system users and applications, as opposed to system-level explainability discussed in LIME and SHAP, which are relevant to developers. Third, our book covers a broad range of applications and, in more technological detail, focuses on reproducibility and usability.
